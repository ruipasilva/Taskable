# Taskable

![Taskable Preview](taskable-preview.jpg)

Taskable helps people keep track of projects and goals. The Overview tab gives them a glance of their overall progress and high priorities. Built purely in SwifUI using CoreData. This is an ongoing project and will receive improvements regularly. 



## Introduction

This app was initially created following the UltimatePortfolio App by Paul Hudson @[Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) and then I've added a few extra features and changed the original design.


## My Goal

Being a store manager my incentive was to create an app that could make manager's life easier and by creating Taskable I was able to practice as much Swift as I could and have a project ready to get my first iOS developer job and do a career change. 

I wanted to practice passing data through views, explore different and multiple designs and use CoreData.
